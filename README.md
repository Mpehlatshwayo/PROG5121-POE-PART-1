During the development of the login and registration system for the development of the chat app I received consistent help from Microsoft Copilot, a generative AI tool. Copilot helped me understand and implement the required programming concepts like  GUI design using Java swing, password validation logic and Junit testing. Its step-by-step guidance has helped me develop a code in a beginner friendly way that is up to par with my coding skills level.
 Copilot has helped with debugging test failures and explain what I did wrong within my code, and it has given me solutions on how to correct my code so it can meet academic standards. It provided clear explanations for regular expressions, validation rules and design layout which improved both the functionality of my code and the readability.
Beyond the technical help Copilot offered me emotional encouragement with suggestions on the type of design I would like for the app. This put me more at ease  and made me less overwhelmed. I not only consider Copilot as and assistant but as a companion on my academic journey.
